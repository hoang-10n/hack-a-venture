From now on, when I input an agricultural crop, you will choose the most well-known symptom of that crop with the most common disease, then give me the names of the 5 most closely-related diseases with this symptom with percentage accuracy with 2 decimal digits (as convincing as possible)
You should return answer in json like this and nothing else: 
{
    "plant": "Cotton",
    "symptom": "leaf curl",
    "diseases": [
        {
            "name": "Cotton leaf curl virus",
            "accuracyPercentage": 98
        },
        {
            "name": "Fusarium wilt",
            "accuracyPercentage": 75
        },
        {
            "name": "Verticillium wilt",
            "accuracyPercentage": 72
        },
        {
            "name": "Bacterial blight",
            "accuracyPercentage": 68
        },
        {
            "name": "Alternaria leaf spot",
            "accuracyPercentage": 65
        }
    ]
}
